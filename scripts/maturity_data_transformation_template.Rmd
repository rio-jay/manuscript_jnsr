This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#----COMPOUND BAR CHART----
#Created by P. Stikker.

#getting the example data
install.packages("foreign")
library(foreign)
#you need to change the file in the code below to your data file.
myData <- read.csv("data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#creating a cross table with percentages:
myTable<-table(myData$Teach_Motivate,myData$Location)
myTable2<-prop.table(myTable, 2)
myTable2

#the basic compound bar chart:
barplot(myTable2)

#add a description to the vertical axis and perhaps some color:
barplot(myTable2, xlab="location",col=1:5)

#adding a legend:
barplot(myTable2,legend = rownames(myTable2), xlab="location",col=1:5)


#Using ggplot2:
#Convert table to dataframe
myData2<-as.data.frame.matrix(myTable2)
#Add rownames as separate variable:
myData2$rating<-rownames(myData2)
#Convert to long format:
install.packages("reshape2")
library(reshape2)
myDataLong<-melt(myData2, id.vars=c("rating"), value.name = "proportion")
#Rename variable:
names(myDataLong)[2]<-paste("location")

#Then the plot:
install.package("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(y = proportion, 
                        x = location, 
                        fill = rating), 
                    data = myDataLong,
                    stat="identity")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
